    "The 1865 civil code was the first codified citizenship law after the unification of Italy. It set up Italy as granting citizenship via Jus Sanguinis. In other words, if a child had an Italian father, they were granted Italian citizenship",
    
    "Legge 555/1912, more commonly known as the \"1912 law\", clarified several aspects of Italian citizenhsip. It made it clear that a child born in a country that grants citizenship jus solis retains Italain citizneship. Because the act of being born in a country that grants citizenship by birth is not voluntary, children cannot give up their citizenship. The law also made it clear that the naturalization of the parents of a minor child did not nullify the citizenship of the child",
    
    "In 1948, the Italian Constitution went into effect. This officially transformed Italy from a Kingdom into a Republic. The major change to citizenship with the enactment of the constitution was the provision that established equal rights between men and women. This made it so citizenship could be transferred by an Italian mother in addtion to an Italian father.",
    
    "In 1975, the legal age of majority in Italy changed from 21 to 18. Therefore, from this point, minor derivative natualizations only occur if the child is under 18",
    
    "Italy substantially revised its citizenship laws to make dual citizenship more accepted. Prior to August 15, 1992, adult Italian citizens who naturalized with another country lost their Italian citizenship. In many cases they could also jeopardize even their previously born  minor children’s Italian citizenship. However, starting on August 15, 1992, Italians naturalizing with another country retain their Italian citizenship.",

    On the 26th November 2018, the Minister of the Interior at the time, Matteo Salvini, issued a new security decree (decreto di sicurezza). The decree was converted into law by Parliament a few months later.

    The security decree, amongst other things, changes the necessary requirements to apply for citizenship via marriage and via naturalization. Citizenship by descent (jure sanguinis) is NOT affected by this decreto.

    Effective December 4, 2018, all new applicants (existing applications before this date are NOT affected) for citizenship by marriage (jure matrimonio) and by resident naturalization must now meet an Italian language fluency requirement. Applicants must pass a language test and present a B1 (or greater) level certificate with their application for citizenship. The level of the language required to reach B1 is in accordance with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.

    The decreto also modified the amount of time the Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Foreign Affairs are allotted to process your application. The original length was two (2) years from official receipt of your application and supporting materials. That period is now allowed to take up to four (4) years from the date of official receipt of all material.
